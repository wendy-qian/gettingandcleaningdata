# Getting and Cleaning Data for Data Science Coursera - Course 3, Week 4

This repository is for the "Getting and Cleaning" Data Course Project for the Data Science Coursera class. 

## The Data

You get the data for the project at this link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

You'll need to put this data in an accessible folder, and edit the script's working directory as needed in order to successfully run the code and produce a tidy data set. 

## The Script

The file run_analysis.R is the script in this repository that merges the relevant data, extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation, gives the data descriptive names, and ultimately creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable. 

Please refer to CodeBook.md for more detailed information on how the analysis works.
